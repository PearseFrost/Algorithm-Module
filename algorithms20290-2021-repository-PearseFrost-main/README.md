This repository represents my algorithm development throughout the course.It ranges from different sorting methods to tries and many other algorithms.I have submitted all the practicals i have attempted throughout this module to my best attempt and have made zip files for each practical apart from the practicals that only required code and in those i have just submitted a java file.In the ones that required answers to short questions i have made a zip file so i could upload the code and the word document as one.

I hope this repository reflects the amount of work i have put into this module and reflects in my final grade.
Many thanks,
Pearse Frost.
